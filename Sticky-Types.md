Jira factory allows user to query a Jira repository using a REST request. User must set the URL of the JIRA, a REST request and a login to connect to Jira. This will create a sticky on the board. To get or update tickets from JIRA, user must click on the refresh button ![icon refresh](./assets/images/icon-factory-refresh.jpg). User’s connection token is required to connect to the JIRA and get the tickets. They pop over the factory sticky and can’t be updated. 

Besides, user can get a single jira-ticket by clicking button ![icon add](./assets/images/icon-factory-add.jpg). 

User can temporary archive a ticket using a functionality called Warp zone. The warp zone is located at the bottom right corner with this image ![icon warp zone](./assets/images/icon-factory-warpzone.jpg). To put a ticket into the warp zone, just move it over the image. It will disappear, but it is not removed until the factory is refreshed. To restore it and display it again on the board, you must search it using the search bar.
